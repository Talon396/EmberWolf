Wolfbox is a fantasy computer that takes inspiration from UNIX workstations made in the late 80s.

The goal of WolfBox is to design a workstation that, in theory, could be made in real life using FPGAs and Atmel microcontrolers.

This is currently a Work In Progress and some features are incomplete.
